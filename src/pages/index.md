Well-governed content management using public ledger technology

---

Every organization has needs for capturing and maintaining content, including documentation and ranging from "booklet" to full publications.  This project enables any organization to use public-ledger technology and shared governance practices to support useful workflows, engaging the right audiences to develop key organizational materials for the good of that organization.  

Our use of decentralized technology supports many different engagement models, ranging from small private groups to wide-open communities.

## How does it work?

cMDBook uses Cardano's blockchain technology, running on both public- and privately-operated networks to reliably create records of an organization's documentation.  Its "on-chain" storage technology enables global-scale consensus, one organization at a time, while enabling every client organization to maintain strong privacy and/or transparency, according to their particular needs.

#### In the application

People can create a new scope of documentation directly in our application, and invite others to work on their project.  People working together in a project can propose changes in-app, and the documentation can evolve entirely through in-app workflow without need for complicated interactions.

#### Through the dAPI

cMDBook will also offer a dAPI interface, allowing documentation to be processed programmatically and using command-line tools.  A dAPI works similarly to a traditional API or SDK, with well-documented points of access to application-specific details and functionality, yet without any need for a centralized server operated by a SaaS provider.  

All functions of an application's UI are typically available within that application's dAPI.  

This supports a CORE PRINCIPLE OF OPENNESS, and is an integration point enabling you to conduct mass-importing or mass-exporting activities, create custom UI and other automations for additional use-cases supporting your creativity.

## How was cMDBook created?

cMDBook was originally sponsored by Cardano's Project Catalyst, in a form originally scoped for proprietary integration with an off-chain ("web 2") application.  We have reframed the scope of that work in order to more broadly open the ability for anyone to use the pattern of collaboratively maintaining Markdown documentation, without being bound to a proprietary or centralized application.

cMDBook leverages the Stellar Contracts dApp-development library and Cardano's own Helios smart-contract language.  


We owe a debt of gratitude (and contributor tokens!) to a whole bunch of people and organizsations, including (in no special order) Maija, Adam, Peter, Alex, Nori, Tevo, Jo, Session, Piotr, James, Tom, George, Felix, Project Catalyst, Gimbalabs, ODIN, and many others.  If you're on this list, or think you should be, please be in touch with us

## Collaborations

Are you working on a project with similar goals?  Do let us cooperate!  Our specialty with on-chain operations and smart-contracts would blend nicely with a project having an existing focus on user-experiences of decentralized change-management.
